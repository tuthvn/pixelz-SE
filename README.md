# System Design

## Data Models and Schemas

### Order
- `order_id`: UUID
- `order_name`: String
- `order_status`: Enum (PENDING, PAID, FAILED)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp

### User
- `user_id`: UUID
- `email`: String
- `name`: String

### Invoice
- `invoice_id`: UUID
- `order_id`: UUID (Foreign Key)
- `amount`: Decimal
- `status`: Enum (CREATED, SENT, FAILED)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp

### Payment
- `payment_id`: UUID
- `order_id`: UUID (Foreign Key)
- `amount`: Decimal
- `status`: Enum (PENDING, SUCCESSFUL, FAILED)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp

## Relevant HTTP Endpoints

### Order Service
- `GET /orders?name={order_name}`: Search orders by name
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/checkout`: Checkout an order

### Payment Service (Mocked)
- `POST /payments`: Process a payment (simulate both success and failure)

### Email Service (Mocked)
- `POST /emails`: Send an email (simulate both success and failure)

### Production Service (Mocked)
- `POST /production/orders`: Update order status in the production system (simulate both success and failure)

---

## Components and Interactions

### Order Service
- Handles CRUD operations for orders
- Initiates the checkout process

### Payment Service
- Mocked service to handle payment transactions

### Email Service
- Mocked service to send confirmation emails to clients

### Production Service
- Mocked service to update the order status in the production system

---

## Assumptions and Validations

### Assumptions
- Payment transactions can be either successful or failed
- Email sending can be either successful or failed
- Production system updates can be either successful or failed

### Validations
- Validate order existence before checkout
- Validate payment status before sending an email and updating the production system

---

## Plan for Delivery

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- Understand the detailed requirements
- Define the scope and boundaries

### Phase 2: Design
- Design data models and schemas
- Design system architecture and interactions

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Implement Order Service
- Implement mocked Payment, Email, and Production services
- Implement integration and unit tests

### Phase 4: Testing
- Perform integration testing
- Perform end-to-end testing

### Phase 5: Deployment
- Deploy services to a staging environment
- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT)
- Deploy to production

---

## Time Tracking

- Requirements Analysis: 4 hours
- Design: 6 hours
- Implementation: 24 hours
- Testing: 12 hours
- Deployment: 4 hours
- **Total: 50 hours**

---

## Codebase Structure

### Order Service
- `controllers`: Handle HTTP requests
- `models`: Define data schemas
- `services`: Business logic
- `repositories`: Database interactions
- `tests`: Unit and integration tests

### Payment Service (Mocked)
- `controllers`: Handle HTTP requests
- `services`: Business logic
- `tests`: Unit and integration tests

### Email Service (Mocked)
- `controllers`: Handle HTTP requests
- `services`: Business logic
- `tests`: Unit and integration tests

### Production Service (Mocked)
- `controllers`: Handle HTTP requests
- `services`: Business logic
- `tests`: Unit and integration tests

---

## Data Integrity Management

### Database Transactions
- Use transactions to ensure atomic operations for order checkout and payment processing

### Consistency Checks
- Implement consistency checks between services (e.g., ensure order status is updated only if payment is successful)

---

## Performance Management

### Caching
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., order details)

### Asynchronous Processing
- Use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations (e.g., sending emails)

### Load Balancing
- Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances

---

## Detailed Showcase

### Example Flow for Checkout Process

#### Search Orders
- `GET /orders?name=sample_order`
- Response: List of orders matching the name

#### Checkout Order
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/checkout`
- Order Service checks order status
- Order Service calls Payment Service
- Payment Service processes payment (simulate success or failure)
- If payment is successful:
  - Order Service updates order status to PAID
  - Order Service calls Email Service to send confirmation email
  - Order Service calls Production Service to update the order status
- If payment fails:
  - Order Service updates order status to FAILED

---

## Conclusion

This design provides a robust and scalable solution for handling order checkouts, ensuring data integrity and performance. By mocking the Payment, Email, and Production services, we can simulate various scenarios and validate the system's behavior under different conditions.
